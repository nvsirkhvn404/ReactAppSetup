# ReactAppSetup

This tool automatically sets up a complete React project with:

- Vite + React
- Tailwind CSS (v4)
- shadcn/ui (with neutral base color)
- Poppins font
- Custom `vite.config.js`, `jsconfig.json`, and `components.json`
- Custom `src` folder with a working Button component
- Automatic dev server start

Everything is downloaded from this GitHub repo, applied to the current folder, and all temporary files are cleaned up.
